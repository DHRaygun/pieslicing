# pieslicing
Creates a pie slice over an image. A few lines of code are unused, as they were intially intended to create an instagram bot (in which the program would automatically upload the image to an instagram account once edits were applied). As of now, the Instagram API has broken the instabot library. This is my first Github project upload, so please bear with me through any errors you may find.
